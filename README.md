#### me, myself and i

‚ö° When I was just a "young'n'wild kiddo", I used to spend a lot of time on computers. 
> **Here's a fun-fact**: My dad had to re-install my computer every 3 months because I was too reckless about "hacking" or testing apps on my Windows 98 PC.

‚åõ Since then: I still have habits to "experiment" (at my own scale) on related tech stuff. In the meantime, I became an adult with responsabilites, & new hobbies so... all the nerdy preoccupations aren't as persistant as before. ü§ì

#### more info coming up

üìπ Still creating content [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfJazBeaJ6zrUw12PknKHVQ "my own YouTube channel"), where I share some of my passions - like *animation & music*.

üê∏ Currently working on [@toonsquadco](https://toonsquad.co/) - a convenient place to track & learn more about the western animation industry:

On this project, I'm practicing, reflecting and developing competencies about *leadership - team management*. 

I want know how to build the perfect workflow for our platform - by learning "how to Git", using the right tools and find the best way to communicate by practicing.
