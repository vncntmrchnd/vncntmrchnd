### hello.

üë®üèª‚ÄçüöÄ My name is Vincent, but you can call me "Vince" ‚Ä¢ pronouns: he/him.

#### me, myself and i

‚ö° When I was just a young and wild kid, I used to spend a lot of time on computers. 
> **Here's a fun-fact**: My dad had to re-install my computer every 3 months because I was too reckless about "hacking" or testing apps on my Windows 98 PC.

‚åõ Since that: I, still, have habits to "experiment" (at my own scale) on related tech stuff. 
But then, I became a [content creator](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfJazBeaJ6zrUw12PknKHVQ "YouTube channel") so... all the nerdy preoccupations aren't as persistant as before. ü§ì

#### more info coming up

üê∏ Currently working on [@toonsquadco](https://toonsquad.co/) - praticing management.
Glad and love to create/build projects with a lot of enthusiasm and perseverance like toonsquad or even a whole [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfJazBeaJ6zrUw12PknKHVQ "the link was already up there") since 2009.

üìù I would be pleased to work, learn, share and collaborate... That's why I'm here - learning "how to Git" and to build a workflow around a platform - in this case, [toonsquad](https://toonsquad.co/). 

> *This adventure is important for me, and the crew, we're still looking for help on any aspect of our project.   Please check out our [website](https://toonsquad.co/) or our [Discord](https://discord.gg/3yXQzC256m) to join the crew!*
